/**
 * The classes that implement this interface are responsible for managing custom
 * tool tips for message-related controls in the form header. By default, a
 * simple manager is installed by the form that uses the built-in widget tool
 * tips for this purpose. Clients can replace this behaviour with richer tool
 * tips that show images, links and other content.
 * <p>
 * The message-related controls in the header are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Image label - used to replace the form title image with the message type
 * image</li>
 * <li>Message label - renders the message as a static text.</li>
 * <li>Message hyperlink - renders the message as a hyperlink.</li>
 * </ul>
 * The message manager will be asked to create the tool tip for any and all of
 * the controls listed above in its factory method. After that, it will be asked
 * to update whenever the message information changes in the form. For this
 * reason, the manager is expected to retain references to the tool tips and
 * update them with new content when asked.
